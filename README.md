### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I`m an MSCS student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, graduating in Fall 2023.
- Last summer I worked as a back-end software engineer at [Odin Inc.](https://odin-inc.com/), a Point-of-Sale solution company for schools.
- [Snakes-and-Ladders-RPG](https://jkvin114.github.io/Snakes-and-Ladders-RPG-wiki/index.html) is my personal web multiplayer boardgame project created using Node.js and MongoDB.
